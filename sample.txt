A Georgia cattleman drives into one of his pastures early one frosty January morning and finds ten cows lying dead. Pastures were very short so the day before he had put a big bale of high-quality pearl millet hay for the cows to eat. Later, the veterinarian diagnosed nitrate toxicity. A terrible loss. Why? Maybe it was ignorance, more likely it was failure to take the necessary precautions at the right time to avoid such a serious loss. Now during the autumn season is a good time to take stock of hay supplies and protect oneself from potential livestock losses as a result of nitrate toxicity.

Pastures and hay plants take up nitrogen from the soil, primarily in the form of nitrate. Under good growing conditions, the nitrate is rapidly converted into nitrite, then into ammonia, then into plant proteins. However, when plant growth is slowed or stopped because of drought or frost, nitrate continues to be taken up by the plant but it cannot be changed into other forms of nitrogen fast enough and nitrate accumulates. When the animals eat this forage as hay or pasture, nitrate poisoning can occur. Although drought and frost are the primary factors causing plants to accumulate nitrate, small grains may accumulate toxic levels during periods of very cloudy weather. Also, many weeds can accumulate toxic levels of nitrate after they have been sprayed with 2,4-D or 2,4-DB herbicides.

Certain plants are more likely to accumulate toxic levels of nitrate than others. Pearl millet, sorghum-sudangrass, johnsongrass and oats are known to be accumulators. Grasses that have been highly fertilized with nitrogen and harvested under severe moisture stress such as bermudagrass, corn, forage sorghum, or tall fescue may also have toxic levels. Weedy hay may accentuate the problem as certain weeds such as pigweed, smartweed, thistle, lambsquarter, goldenrod, nightshade, and stinging nettle are known accumulators of nitrate.
